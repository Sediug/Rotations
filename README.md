A game made with LibGDX 4.0 (Java)

This is a proyect that I did to learn how to make a 2D videogames with the framework LibGDX. You can use all that you need of this proyect for your own proyects, feel yourself free to do it. I have to say thanks to all the people who have the property of images or sound of the game. I found it on opengameart.org , It's an amazing web page, with a lot of free media and images. All those people are put in the credits screen of the game. Sorry if I forget to put someone ;/.

You are welcome to come and explain me what I should improve, in the game and also in my code style or my logic.
