A game made with LibGDX 4.0 (Java)

This is a proyect that I did to learn how to make a 2D videogames with the framework LibGDX. You can use all that you need of this proyect for your own proyects, feel yourself free to do it. I have to say thanks to all the people who have the property of media in the game. I found it on opengameart.org , It's an amazing web page, with a lot of free media and images. All those people are put in the credits screen of the game (I know that it's dificult to see but I'm currently working to solve the bug, I'm sorry). Sorry if I forgot to put someone ;/.

The proyect is not finished at the present and it was done with a short time so there are many things that could be  (and must be) improved. But it works on android and pc.

(12 / 06 / 2015) I made it on the last christmas, I will review the code and solve all bugs in the next weeks, do the documentation, and improve to much the code (I can do it alot of better but I develop it only in 2 weeks at christmas holidays and very fast). After this I will try to put it at  at the Play Store.

You are welcome to come and explain to me what I need to improve. In the game and also in my code style or my logic.
