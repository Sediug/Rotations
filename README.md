A game made with LibGDX 4.0 (Java)

This is a proyect that I did to learn how to make 2D videogames with the framework LibGDX. You can use all that you need of this proyect for your own proyects, feel yourself free to do it. I have to say thanks to all the people who have the property of some of the images or sounds in the game. I found it on opengameart.org , It's an amazing web page, with a lot of free media and images. All those people are put in the credits screen of the game. 

You are welcome to come and explain me what I should improve, in the game and also in my code.
